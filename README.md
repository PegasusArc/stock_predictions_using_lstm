# üìà Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict **stock prices** using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series data due to their ability to capture and remember patterns over long sequences.

## üîπ Project Overview

The goal is to predict future stock prices for a specific company (Apple) using historical data (`AAPL.csv`). The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load historical stock data and visualize key features like `Open`, `Close`, and `Volume`.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Scale data and structure it into sequences suitable for an LSTM model.
3. **Model Building**: Construct an LSTM-based deep learning model using Keras to capture temporal patterns.
4. **Training and Prediction**: Train the model and predict future stock prices.
5. **Evaluation and Visualization**: Assess performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualize predictions vs actual prices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## üìä Dataset

The project uses a CSV file named `AAPL.csv` containing historical stock data for Apple. Required columns include:

- `Date`
- `Open`
- `Close`
- `Volume`
- Others (as needed)

## üîπ Analysis and Modeling

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization
- **Open vs Close Price**: Visualizes stock price fluctuations over time.  
- **Volume**: Shows trading volume trends, indicating market sentiment.  
- **Close Price**: Used as the primary feature for LSTM prediction.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Selection**: Use `Close` price for prediction.  
- **Scaling**: Normalize values between 0 and 1 using `MinMaxScaler`.  
- **Sequence Creation**: Create sequences of 60 previous closing prices to predict the 61st closing price.

### 3. LSTM Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: LSTM layer with 64 units, `return_sequences=True`.  
- **Second LSTM Layer**: LSTM with 64 units.  
- **Dense Layer**: Fully connected layer with 32 units.  
- **Dropout Layer**: Dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.  
- **Output Layer**: Dense layer with 1 unit for predicted stock price.

### 4. Training and Evaluation

- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Epochs:** 10  

**Metrics:**  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### 5. Results Visualization

- Compare **actual vs predicted stock prices** using plots to visually assess model performance.

### üöÄ Future Improvements

- Tune hyperparameters and increase the number of epochs for improved performance.  
- Use additional features (e.g., `Volume`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`) for **multivariate prediction**.  
- Experiment with advanced models like **GRU**, **Bidirectional LSTM**, or **Transformer-based time series models**.  
- Implement **walk-forward validation** for robust time-series evaluation.
